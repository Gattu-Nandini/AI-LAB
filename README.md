12. The following is a function that counts the number of times a string occurs in another string: # Count the number of times string s1 is found in string s2 defcountsubstring(s1,s2):
count = 0 for i in range(0,len(s2)-len(s1)+1): if sl s2[i:i+len(s1)]: count += return For instance, count substring ('ab', 'cabalaba') returns 2. 1
count
Write a recursive version of the above function. To get the rest of a string (i.e. everything but the first character).
13. Higher order functions. Write a higher-order function count that counts the number of elements in a list that satisfy a given test. For instance: count (lambda x: x>2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 3, as there are three elements in the list larger than 2. Solve this task without using any existing higher order function.
14. Brute force solution to the Knapsack problem. Write a function that allows you to generate random problem instances for the knapsack program. This function should generate a list of
